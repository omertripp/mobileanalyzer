\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{Se:conclusion}

We have presented \Tool, a comprehensive testing algorithm for (inbound) IAC integrity threats, which is available as a commercial cloud service. \Tool\
maintains a feedback loop, such that custom IAC parameters detected on the fly are later explored and tested. Path exploration is governed by efficient manipulation of boolean IAC parameters. \Tool\ currently tests for eight different IAC attack vectors. In our experiments over 80 top-popular apps, we have established the justification for different design choices that \Tool\ embodies, and have demonstrated \Tool\ to be effective overall with the ability to detect 150/163 known IAC vulnerabilities in the benchmark suite (recall rate of $>92\%$).

In the future, we plan to extend \Tool\ to handle more aspects of Android IAC, including (i) fuzzing of integral extra parameter; (ii) attacking other components beyond {\tt Activity}s; and (iii) accounting for multi-app attack scenarios, such that the payload flows across multiple appllications (not only components, which \Tool\ supports already; cf. \cite{RALB:ARES14}). In addition, we intend to search for analogous forms of attack in other platforms (mainly iOS).
